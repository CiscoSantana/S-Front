# Saipher's test

<p>This week, I took a test to join the developers' team at Saipher ATC.</p>
<p></p>The purpose of this test was to evaluate the candidate's ability to build a user management system (CRUD), with a focus on good development practices, use of design patterns, and a moderate level of autonomy in choosing the technical solution.</p>

<h2>System Requirements:</h2>

<p>Create a web application with two screens: Login and User Management.
Access to the User Management screen must be protected by authentication.
Allow the addition, editing, and viewing of users in a user-friendly interface.</p>





This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.
